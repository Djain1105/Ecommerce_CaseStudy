# Case_Study

An E-Commerce platform is about to launch a store in a city of your choice. This store will be open for 18 hours every day, seven days a week, and is expected to handle 2000 orders daily. The store's size will be 2000 square feet, with specific dimensions of 50 feet by 40 feet, resembling the attached image. Some points to keep in mind:
• The orders will be assigned to a delivery partner (driver) only if they are available at the store.
• Given that this is a new store, the challenge at hand is to organize and manage inventory within the store.

Obejctive:

Create an assessment report including the following:
1. How many delivery partners (drivers) would be necessary to fulfill the orders without compromising e-commerce's unique selling proposition (USP) and customer experience?
2. How many workers would be required inside the store to pick and pack the orders, taking into account an average of 5 items per order?
